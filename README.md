# Mancala

## Introduction
I originally made a messy and albeit even crappier version of a mancala AI for University of Colorado Boulder's 
CSCI 3202: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. The project consisted of an altered form of mancala and a min-max 
algorithm in a Jupyter Notebook. Recently, my girlfriend and I have been playing a lot of mancala, and I have been
losing so badly, I decided to overhaul my code, and turn it into a project I could be proud of (and maybe use to get 
some wins) ðŸ˜…! 

## Getting Started 
Clone/fork the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download the 
necessary dependencies.

## Running Simulations
Run `streamlit run Home.py` to launch the UI for running game simulations.
